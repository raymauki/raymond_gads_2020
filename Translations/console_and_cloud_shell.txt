#Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class:

mkdir infraclass

#Create a file called config in the infraclass directory:

touch infraclass/config

#Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file:

echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config

#Create a second environment variable for my Project ID

INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[MY_PROJECT_ID]

#Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file:

echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config

#Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set:

source infraclass/config
echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

#Edit the shell profile with the following command:

nano .profile

#Add the following line to the end of the file:

source infraclass/config

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
